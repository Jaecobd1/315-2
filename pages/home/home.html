<h2>
    Homework Three
</h2>

<p>Within this homework I was to add buttons on the browse page. These buttons have event listeners that will then both console log and alert the name of the button. I also have added a View button that is not visiable on full screen unless you hover but
    always visable on mobile.</p>
